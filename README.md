# GO Game in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)

This project is a simple implementation of the ancient game of **GO** using Python. The game is recreated in a Jupyter Notebook environment, providing a clean and interactive way to play and learn the rules of GO. The main focus of this project is to simulate the board, place stones, and implement basic gameplay rules.

## Project Overview

The game of GO is a board game that originated in China over 2,500 years ago. It is one of the oldest and most complex games still played today. The game is played with black and white stones, and the goal is to surround the opponent's stones and capture them.

In this project, I've recreated the essential mechanics of GO, including:

- A 19x19 GO board.
- Functionality to place black and white stones on the board.
- Basic rules for capturing stones.
- Implementation of group and liberty concepts.

This implementation is purely for educational purposes and demonstrates how Python can be used to model and simulate board games.
